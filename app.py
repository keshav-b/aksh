    #             At Walmart, during my PM internship, I was tasked with improving adoption for a feature in our logistics platform. A key enterprise customer, responsible for a significant portion of our revenue, had reported dissatisfaction with the feature, claiming it didn‚Äôt address their specific use case. This escalated to leadership, putting pressure on me to resolve it.
    #             My goal was to understand their pain points, ensure they felt heard, and determine whether the issue was a product gap or a miscommunication. I also needed to balance their needs with our roadmap priorities.
    #             Customer Empathy: I organized a call with the customer to listen directly to their concerns. Rather than jumping to conclusions, I asked probing questions to understand the nuances of their workflows and why our solution wasn‚Äôt fitting their needs.

    #             Internal Collaboration: Post-call, I facilitated a meeting with the engineering and design teams to analyze the feasibility of their requests. I mapped their concerns to our product capabilities and identified a misalignment in how they were using the feature compared to how it was designed.

    #             Solution Design: I worked with the customer to co-create a temporary workaround while advocating for a longer-term fix in our backlog. I provided them with tailored documentation and a clear timeline for the planned updates.

    #             Proactive Communication: I kept the customer updated weekly on our progress, ensuring transparency. Simultaneously, I conducted an impact analysis and shared it with leadership to secure buy-in for prioritizing the fix.


    #             The customer was satisfied with the transparency and the temporary solution, allowing them to meet their immediate business goals. Once the fix was deployed, their adoption of the feature increased by 30%, and their NPS improved significantly. The episode also revealed a broader gap in how we communicated feature use cases to customers, leading us to improve onboarding materials for all users.
